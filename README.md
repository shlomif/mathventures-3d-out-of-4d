TeX sources of the MathVentures' riddle
[Combinatorics and the Art of Dungeons and Dragons](http://www.shlomifish.org/MathVentures/3d-outof-4d-mathml.xhtml)

1. Throw 4 dice, sum the numbers they generated and subtract the lowest value from the sum. (if there is more than one die with the lowest value, subtract it only once). What is the average number of such throws?

More generally, one can ask: 2. Throw n dice, each evenly generating values in the range 1 .. m, sum them, and subtract the number of the lowest die. What is the average of the solutions of this throw? (the expression is dependant on n and m.)

And yet more generally: 3. Throw n dice each in the range 1..m, sum them and subtract the p lowest dice (p < n). What is the average outcome of this throw?
